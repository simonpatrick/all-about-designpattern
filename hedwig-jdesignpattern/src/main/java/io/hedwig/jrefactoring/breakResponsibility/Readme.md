When breaking apart responsibilities on a class this is enforcing 
Single Responsiblity Principle from SOLID.

As you can see here, the Video class has two responsibilities, 
once for handling video rentals, 
and another for managing how many rentals a customer has.
We can break out the customer logic into 
itâ€™s own class to help separate the responsibilities.
