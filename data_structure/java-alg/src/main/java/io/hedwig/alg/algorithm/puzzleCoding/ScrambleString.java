 * Scramble string, for two strings, say str1 = �tiger� and str2 = �itreg�

 * In above case, since s1 can be generated from str2, that is, str1 can be generated from the partition tree,
 * which has the same leaf of str2, but the order of its child can be switched.
 * So str1 is said to be a scramble string of str2.
 * <p/>
 * A counter example is that Tiger and Tgrie are not scramble string of each other
 * <p/>
 * The principle of this approach goes as following
 * 1) Given two strings A and B, try to split each of them into two sub-strings sA1,sA2,sB1,
 * sB2 where sA1 and sB1 are anagrams and sA2 and sB2 are anagrams.
 * 2) If sA1 and sB1 are the scramble strings while sA2 and sBs are scramble strings,
 * then A and B should be scramble strings.
 * 3) Recursively analyze sA1 and sB1, sA2 and sB2 by start over from step 1).
 * <p/>
 * In previous example
 * <p/>
 * str1 = aabbbaccd, str2: aabcdbcba,
 * <p/>
 * They are split as: (aab)(bbaccd),  (aab)(cdbcba) => compare bbaccd and cdbcba
 * They are split as: (bbac)(cd),  (cd)(bcba) => compare bbac and bcba
 * They are split as: (b)(bac), b(cba) => (ba)(c) vs (c)(ba)
