Todayâ€™s refactoring is based on the c2 wiki entry and can be found here. Los Techies own Chris Missal also did a very informative post on the antipattern that you can find here.
Simply put, the arrowhead antipattern is when you have nested conditionals so deep that they form an arrowhead of code. I see this very often in different code bases and it makes for high cyclomatic complexity in code.
