/* 
 * Cracking the coding interview (5th edition)
 * Chapter 5 - Bit Manipulation
 * 
 * Question 5.1
 * You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write
 * a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can
 * assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if
 * M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You
 * would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit
 * between bit 3 and bit 2.
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
 * Output: N = 10001001100
 * 
 * Solution - pg 242
