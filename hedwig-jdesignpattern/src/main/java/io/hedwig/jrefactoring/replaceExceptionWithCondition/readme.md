Today's refactoring doesn't come from any place specifically, just something I've picked up over time that I find myself using often. Any variations/comments would be appreciated to this approach. I think there's some other good refactorings around these type of problems.
Exceptions should only be there to do exactly what they are for, handle exceptional behavior. Most of the time you can replace this type of code with a proper conditional and handle it properly. This is called design by contract in the after example because we are ensuring a specific state of the Motor class before performing the necessary work instead of letting an exception handle it.
