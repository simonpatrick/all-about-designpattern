 * Question 17.5
 * The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:
 * The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red (R),
 * yellow (Y), green (G) or blue (B). For example, the computer might have RGGB
 * (Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue).
 * You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess
 * YRGB.
 * When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a "hit". If you 
 * guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a "pseudo-hit". Note
 * that a slot that is a hit can never count as a pseudo-hit.
 * For example, if the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you have one hit 
 * and one pseudo-hit.
 * Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and
 * pseudo-hits.
 * 
 * Solution - pg 438
